# gigantic-api

Self-hosted API to pull stats from Gigantic. The goal is to have it hosted so others can create cool insights into builds or just have a way to programmatically pull stats.

Road-map:
- [] Scrape info into JSON file ~ in progress...
- [] Create Go-based REST API
- [] Dockerize it
- [] Integrate API keys / host the API for use

[Mistforge](https://mistforge.net/en-US/news) was a great inspiration for the project. I also just really enjoy the game and am happy it's come back to us.
